	<p>The 2015-2016 season for the Premier League was a crazy one. A team that had the odds against them prevailed and took home the league title. The team that we are talking about is Leicester City. They started off the season with the odds being 5000-1 for them to win the premier league. However, these odds did not shake them as they went on to win it all.</p>
	<p>You might be asking, if they won the premier league, how did they have such bad odds at the beginning of the season? Well, the 2014-2015 season dictated their odds. They were a couple points away from being relegated, and this meant that they would move down out of the Premier League and into the league below, which was the English Championship League.</p>
	<p>As the season started, they shot up out of nowhere. No one was expecting them to make any run towards the title, but they did so anyways. They were at the top for a decent amount of weeks and towards the end of the season, it got close. However, instead of choking, they held it together and finished 10 points ahead of second place. This is probably one of the greatest underdog stories of our time with the odds this team had against them.</p>
